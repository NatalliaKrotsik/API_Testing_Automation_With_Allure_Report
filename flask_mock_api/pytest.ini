[pytest]
# 1️⃣ Test Discovery: Define where and how to find test files
testpaths = tests  # Look for tests in the "tests" directory
python_files = test_*.py  # Test files must start with "test_"
python_classes = Test*  # Test classes must start with "Test"
python_functions = test_*  # Test functions must start with "test_"

# 2️⃣ Markers: Register custom markers to categorize tests
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (run with 'pytest -m slow')
    database: marks tests that interact with a database
    api: marks API tests

# 3️⃣ Logging: Enable logging in the terminal during test execution
log_cli = true
log_level = INFO

# 4️⃣ Reporting: Generate JUnit XML reports for CI/CD integration
junit_family = xunit2

# 5️⃣ Additional Options: Set extra pytest options
addopts = --strict-markers --tb=short --maxfail=3
